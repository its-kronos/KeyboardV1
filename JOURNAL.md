I started the general planning for the design criteria and also started sourcing some of the parts needed to create the keyboard. This took a lot longer than I expected, and I didn't realise how much actually had to go to making a full-sized keyboard, even after making a macropad before this. 

No images yet as it has mainly been a lot of researching and writing ideas, but here is what I have so far:

* TKL layout (87 keys)
* One rotary Encoder with button (1 key, 2 additional GPIO)
* 10 macro buttons (10 keys)
* Total keys: 98
* Matrix size: 17x6
* total gpio for input keys (disregarding matrix): 10
* total gpio for input keys (regarding matrix): 23
* total gpio for input:25
* gpio for output: 2
* minimum gpio: 27

* USBC connectivity (JLCPCB part C2988369, costing 0.08)
* Cherry MX speed silver switches ([switches](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256802556025161.html?spm=a2g0o.productlist.main.3.5272XBJNXBJNCB&algo_pvid=733cf7a3-43e8-43cd-82f2-136f3680b36f&algo_exp_id=733cf7a3-43e8-43cd-82f2-136f3680b36f-2&pdp_ext_f=%7B%22order%22%3A%2260%22%2C%22eval%22%3A%221%22%7D&pdp_npi=4%40dis%21USD%215.97%215.77%21%21%215.97%215.77%21%402103244817494332643153371e9e82%2112000021935784957%21sea%21US%210%21ABX&curPageLogUid=iXUQrrv9lirg&utparam-url=scene%3Asearch%7Cquery_from%3A)) (for 47.67)
* white to light blue gradient keycaps ([keycaps](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256808583283524.html?spm=a2g0o.productlist.main.1.71ff517bRP8f6k&algo_pvid=5b86f0d0-7a3e-48a7-8888-0f7d0f246e88&algo_exp_id=5b86f0d0-7a3e-48a7-8888-0f7d0f246e88-0&pdp_ext_f=%7B%22order%22%3A%2249%22%2C%22eval%22%3A%221%22%7D&pdp_npi=4%40dis%21USD%2120.14%2119.94%21%21%2120.14%2119.94%21%40210312d517494334827192282e9b8e%2112000046593508858%21sea%21US%210%21ABX&curPageLogUid=8ZD65B0kDTa0&utparam-url=scene%3Asearch%7Cquery_from%3A#nav-specification)) (for 20.22)
* Diodes (JLC part C2099, costing 0.01 each), probable ordering via aliexpress (name: 1N4148W)

Anyways, here are some goals that I have for the next session!!

- Figure out a specific MCU to use and read the datasheets as well as sourcing all the parts required in this step
- Source some stabs
- Source a rotary encoder switch
- learn a bit more about a usb protection IC, should I get one, and if so, source it

**Session length: 1 hour** (ish probably a couple minutes more excluding this journal entry)
